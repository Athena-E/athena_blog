        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Athena, a second year Computer Science student at the University of Cambridge. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in the development of AI/machine learning and would consider it one of my main gateways into Coomputer Science in the first place. Since coming to university, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried getting involved with AI societies and learning about AI safety as well as doing personal research into areas that interest me. Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a growing interest in programming languages and want to be able to purposefully dedicate some time to an area that I don&amp;rsquo;t yet have much experience in; I intend for this blog to be like a log of my journey and also a platform for me to share the interesting things I discover along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
