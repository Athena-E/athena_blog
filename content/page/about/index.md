Hi, I'm Athena, a second year Computer Science student at the University of Cambridge. I'm interested in the development of AI/machine learning and would consider it one of my main gateways into Coomputer Science in the first place. Since coming to university, I've tried getting involved with AI societies and learning about AI safety as well as doing personal research into areas that interest me. Recently, I've had a growing interest in programming languages and want to be able to purposefully dedicate some time to an area that I don't yet have much experience in; I intend for this blog to be like a log of my journey and also a platform for me to share the interesting things I discover along the way.
